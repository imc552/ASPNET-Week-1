# ASPNET-Week-1


Created a product controller called "ProductController" with an Index action that takes the "GetProducts" list from the "Product" model.
ProductController allows the Index view to interact with the product list in the Product model.

The view iterates through the list and displays each entry using an html table.

I was not sure what the instructions meant when wanting Tag Helpers for navigation, since the navigation section of _Layout.cshtml already had Tag Helpers.


Used Copilot to help me with passing the product list from the model to the controller and iterating the model list within the view.
