# ASPNET-Week-1

Added a controller called "ProductController" with an Index action that takes the "ProductList" list from the "Product" model and returns it to the Index View.

The view iterates through the list and displays each entry using an html table.

I was not sure what the instructions meant when wanting Tag Helpers for navigation, since the navigation section of _Layout.cshtml already had Tag Helpers.

Created an html form for buying the products listed in the model.

Used Copilot to help me with passing the product list from the model to the controller and iterating the model list within the view.
