# ASPNET-Week-1


Created a product controller called "ProductController" with an Index method that takes the "GetProducts" list from the "Product" model.
ProductController allows the Index view to interact with the product list in the Product model.


Used Copilot to help me with passing the product list from the model to the controller and iterating the model list within the view.
